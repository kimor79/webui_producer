webui_producer is a set of css, js, and php files to aid in building web UIs.

In the calling app, an ini-style config file is required. When defining
URIs there are several ways to do so:

  base_uri = "http://somehost/some/path"
  base_url = "http://somehost/"
  base_urn = "/some/path"

If base_uri is given then it will be used as the complete base URI. Giving
both base_url and base_urn has the same affect.

If only base_url is given, the path is assumed to be at the root of the
webserver.

If only base_urn is given, the schema, host, and port will be based on
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].

If none of the URI settings are given, the URI will be at the root based on
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];

Sample usage:

In a php file:

 define('WEBUI_PRODUCER_MYAPP', 'myapp');

 include 'webui_producer/v2/classes/base.php';

 try {
         $wui = new WebUIProducerV2Base();
 } catch (Exception $e) {
         echo $e->getMessage();
         exit(0);
 }

 $wui->showGET('id');

In a js file:

 YAHOO.util.Event.onDOMReady(function() {
         W.form.submitGETClick('search-form');
         W.form.submitGETEnter('enter-submit');
 });
